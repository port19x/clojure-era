# Clojure Era

This repo contains all of my clojure projects. \
I used clojure as my main programming language of choice from september '22 to may '23.

The files in this repo are [git bundles.](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle) \
This is preferable over git submodules or git subtrees since I do not intend to keep the remotes of these project up.
